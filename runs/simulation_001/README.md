# README for graph_simulations/runs/simulation_001

## Purpose
The goal here is to simulate hiprfish data.
We should get numpy arrays containing circles made of various values.
We should be able to create different spatial arangements of values.
We also want to get out a node matrix, edge matrix, adjacency matrix, an attriubte matrix for each circle and an attriubte matrix for each edge.

## Approach
Arange values in an array representing a hiprfish image.
- random
- patterned in 1 y dimension (cartesian, horizontal layers)
- patterned in radial dimension (polar, circular layers)
- clusters

Expand values into circles for visualization.
